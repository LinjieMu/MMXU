# MMXU benchmark
**MMXU** (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding) is a novel dataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions between two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address single-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both current and historical patient data.
